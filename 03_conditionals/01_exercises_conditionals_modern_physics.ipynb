Prof. McDonough then selected the most pedagogically relevant exercises and prompted the LLM to create a Jupyter notebook with appropriate notes and the selected exercises.

    "\n",
    "When light strikes a metal surface, it can eject electrons. This phenomenon contradicted classical wave theory in several ways:\n",
    "- Below a certain threshold frequency, *no* electrons are ejected regardless of light intensity\n",
    "- Above this threshold, electrons are ejected immediately with no time delay\n",
    "- The kinetic energy of ejected electrons depends on light frequency, not intensity\n",

    "- Aluminum: 4.28 eV\n",

    "- Gold: 5.1 eV\n",

    "\n",
    "Any photon with $\\lambda > \\lambda_{\\text{threshold}}$ (lower energy) will NOT eject electrons, regardless of intensity!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Einstein's Photoelectric Equation:** When a photon ejects an electron, the excess energy becomes the electron's kinetic energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$KE_{\\text{max}} = E_{\\text{photon}} - W = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - W$$\n",
